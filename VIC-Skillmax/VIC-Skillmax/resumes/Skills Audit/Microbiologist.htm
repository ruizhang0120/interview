<h1>Microbiologist</h1>
<h2>CAREER OBJECTIVE</h2> 
<p>I am a qualified and experienced researcher in environmental microbiology, microbial ecology, soil chemistry and soil fertility seeking a position in a progressive Australian organization that will enable me to apply my excellent research and development skills </p> 
<hr width="80%" size="1"> 
<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS, SKILLS AND ABILITIES</h2> 
<p>Excellent general microbiological skills (aseptic technique, isolation, maintenance and storing of axonic culture, media preparation, biological waste disposal etc). Isolated pentachlorophenol degrading bacteria and microbial consortia from soils, sediments and water. Isolated difficult to culture environmental bacteria using different media</p> 
<p>Proven ability in using molecular techniques in environmental microbiology and microbial ecology. Highly developed skills in extraction and purification of environmental DNA/RNA, PCR techniques (PCR, RE-PCR, RFLP-PCR and real-time PCR), cloning and sequencing techniques, florescence techniques (eg. FITC-FISH), DGGE, TGGE, gel electrophoresis etc. Have succeeded isolating PCR amenable DNA from water, soils, waste, sludge, sediments, subsurface, bones, coprolites and plants. First to use molecular techniques in detecting human associated ancient microbial DNA in lake sediments. Developed and maintained a molecular microbial ecology laboratory in Japan </p> 
<p>Strong background and skills in data mining, informatics and DNA sequence management using NCBI, EMBL and DDBJ databases and associated software (BLAST, FASTA, CLUSTAL, e-PCR etc) and using phylogenetic packages (MEGA, Phyllips, ARB etc) in microbiology. My research on ecology of subsurface microflora has been presented in professional conferences and has been published. New archaeal and bacterial sequences have been deposited in public databases</p> 
<p>Familiar and experienced in environmental science and microbiology protocols. Completed a project that characterized river and lake water in Japan. In this study, chemical, biochemical and biological parameters (pH, EC, Eh, BOD, COD, TOC, biomass, CFU, TDC, CTC, CFDC) of a large number of samples were measured and analyzed overtime leading to meaningful conclusions</p> 
<p>Excellent analytical skills having used pH meters, conductance meters, TOC meters, UVS, AAS, HPLC, GC, chloridometers, flame photometers, micro Kjeldahl apparatus etc extensively</p> 
<p>Proven skills in using equipment found in molecular biological laboratories (centrifuges, bead beaters, shakers, electrophoresis apparatus, DGGE apparatus, electroporators, spectrophotometers, sequencing machines, fluorescence microscopes etc.)</p> 
<p>Strong background and extensive experience in soil chemistry, soil fertility and fertilizers. Initiated and developed a soil testing and plant analysis laboratory. Developed low-cost organic and inorganic fertilizers, tested new techniques that increase fertilizer efficiency, studied micronutrient deficiencies, iron toxicity and many other soil problems   </p>
