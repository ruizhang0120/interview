      <P>Many people still think the resume you put online is not the same 
      document that you created to print out and mail to prospective employers 
      or hand to interviewers. <B>This is untrue.</B> You do not need a 
      different resume, you only need to alter the format of your resume to make 
      it easy for you to post, copy and paste, or email it to employers. 
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>When done correctly, your well-written, well-prepared 
        resume will contain all of the necessary keywords to attract attention

      <H3><A name=vers>Resume Versions to Prepare</A></H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Job search experts recommend you keep duplicates of your 
        resume in each of these versions or formats. 
        <OL>
          <LI>A <B>Print Version</B>, designed with bulleted lists, italicized 
          text, and other highlights, ready to print and mail or hand to 
          potential contacts and interviewers. 
          <LI>A <B>Scannable Version</B>, a less-designed version without the 
          fancy design highlights. Bulleted lists are fine, but that's about the 
          limit. 
          <LI>A <B>Plain Text Version</B>, a plain text file ready to copy and 
          paste into online forms or post in online resume databases. This is 
          also referred to as an ASCII copy. 
          <LI>An <B>E-mail Version</B>, another plain text copy, but this one is 
          specifically formatted for the length-of-line restrictions in e-mail. 
          This is also an ASCII copy. </LI></OL><B>This is the same document 
        presented in four ways, each formatted for a specific delivery 
        purpose.</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <H3><A name=text>Why Plain Text?</A></H3>You could just use the forms 
        most databases provide to build your resume in their system, but resume 
        experts like <A href="http://www.susanireland.com/">Susan Ireland</A> 
        don't recommend you do this for several reasons. 
        <OL>
          <LI><B>They don't let you spell-check.</B> Preparing your resume in 
          advance using your own word processing program allows you to 
          spell-check your resume and revise it as needed until you are happy 
          with it. 
          <LI><B>They force you to use their resume format.</B> Most online 
          forms and builders insist on a chronological resume, which focuses on 
          work history. Career changers who would prefer a functional resume 
          with its emphasis on skills will be at a disadvantage. 
          <LI><B>They don't let you save your work and use it again.</B> If you 
          build it in their database using their form, you've done a lot of work 
          for only one site, which means you will have to repeat your effort for 
          every database you encounter. Prepare it in advance on your own 
          computer and you have it to use as much as you like.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <H3><A name=html>What About an HTML Version?</A></H3>Many job seekers 
        are creating "webbed" resumes in the hopes of being discovered or as a 
        place to refer an employer who might want to see more than what is 
        usually found in a resume. An HTML version of your resume works 
        particularly well for persons in a visual arts field, but it could serve 
        anyone, provided it is done right and for the right reasons. 
        <UL>
          <LI><B>Doing it right</B> means starting with a basic HTML version of 
          your designed resume, not an overloaded page of Shockwave and Java 
          effects, huge graphics, and audio files that takes more than 2 minutes 
          to download over a 56K modem. 
          <LI><B>Doing it for the right reasons</B> means turning your resume 
          into a portfolio, complete with links to former employers or projects 
          already publicly available online. Be sure you are not violating any 
          copyright or confidentiality clauses by putting information online 
          without prior approval. </LI></UL><B>The biggest problem with HTML 
        resumes is TMI - "<I>too much information</I>".</B> Many people make 
        their resumes part of their personal web site, loading it where there is 
        all kinds of information an employer does not need to know before you 
        are hired, including your marital status, ethnic background, religious 
        affiliations, personal interests, past or present health problems, and 
        much more. Allowing an employer to learn so much about you can lead to 
        potential discrimination problems that you may never be aware of for the 
        way you look, your political or religious beliefs or any number of other 
        reasons. 
        <P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>I know some career management professionals advocate the 
          use of photos plus personal biographies for executive clients, stating 
          this is the same information you would find in an executive bio 
          released by the company for publicity purposes. However, <B>I still 
          urge job seekers to be both conservative and conscientious about what 
          you are telling prospective employers before you actually get called 
          into an interview.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Always remember, <B>your resume presents the image you want employers 
        to see.</B> For this reason, it is important that you keep your presence 
        entirely professional, never linking your resume to any personal 
        information. <B>If you decide to add an HTML resume to your campaign, 
        post it in a location separate from your personal web site, and do not 
        link between the two.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>Preparing your resume for e-mail is really an easy process. Anyone 
      creating a resume should take the extra few minutes needed to generate a 
      plain text version while still at the computer. Most word processors and 
      resume-writing programs will let you save a file to plain text. The next 
      step, altering the format, is simple. 
      <P><B>Susan Ireland</B>, a professional resume writer and author of <B>The 
      Complete Idiot's Guide to the Perfect Resume</B>, has come up with very 
      simple instructions for taking you through the formatting process 
      step-by-step. Following these will not only create that perfect plain text 
      resume but will also help you prepare a second one for e-mail's specific 
      formatting problems. I have excerpted these instructions here with her 
      permission, but you'll find the complete instructions along with much more 
      information at <A 
      href="http://www.susanireland.com/">http://www.susanireland.com/</A>. 
      <P><B>Please note that these instructions assume that your resume is in MS 
      Word for Windows, including Windows XP.</B> If your resume is in another 
      word processing application or on a different computer platform like 
      Macintosh, you may need to consult your word processing manual for 
      specific instructions. If you have specific questions or problems about 
      this process, <A href="http://www.susanireland.com/">please contact 
      Susan</A>. She really does want to hear from you! 
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Step 1: Save Your Resume as a Text Only document. </B>A 
        Text Only (<I>called Plain Text in Windows XP</I>) document works best 
        for an electronic resume because you can adjust the margins and 
        formatting to suit the database or E-mail system in which you are 
        working. To convert your MS Word resume to Text Only/Plain Text, do the 
        following: 
        <OL>
          <LI>Open the MS Word document that contains your resume. 
          <LI>Click File in your tool bar and select Save As. 
          <LI>Type in a new name for this document in File Name, such as 
          "ResTextOnly." 
          <LI>Under this is the Save As Type pull-down menu. From this list, 
          select "Text Only (*.txt). If you're on a <B>Windows XP computer</B>, 
          select "Plain Text" from the pull-down menu. 
          <LI>Click Save to perform the conversion. 
          <LI>Now close the document but stay in MS Word. 
          <LI>Reopen the document you just closed by going to File in the tool 
          bar, click Open, select the file named "ResTextOnly.txt," and click 
          Open. <B>Warning: If you exit MS Word and then open the resume 
          document by clicking on its icon in the directory, it will be opened 
          in Notepad -- not what you want if you intend to use this version to 
          prepare an e-mailable resume</B> </LI></OL>After converting your resume 
        to Text Only, what appears in your document window is your resume 
        stripped of any fancy formatting. You are now ready to make a few final 
        adjustments before posting it online: 
        <P><B>Step 2: Check keywords.</B> Make sure you have all the keywords 
        that define your job qualifications. 
        <P><B>Step 3: Delete any references to "page two," "Continued," or your 
        name or head on page 2.</B> You are making your resume appear as one 
        continuous electronic document. 
        <P><B>Step 4: Use all CAPS for words that need special emphasis.</B> For 
        the best overall effect, use all caps sparingly and judiciously, 
        highlighting only what you really want to have stand out. 
        <P><B>Step 5: Replace each bullet point with a standard keyboard symbol. 
        </B>Suggested replacements are:<BR>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>Dashes (<B>-</B>)<BR>Plus signs (<B>+</B>)<BR>Single or 
          Double Asterisks (<B>*</B>) (<B>**</B>)<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>Use the Space 
        Bar, not the Tab Key, to place a single space immediately after each 
        symbol (and before the words). Allow the lines to wrap naturally at the 
        end of a line. Don't put a forced return (don't push the Return or Enter 
        key) if it's not the end of the statement and don't indent the second 
        line of a statement with the Space Bar. 
        <P><B>Step 6: Use straight quotes in place of curly quotes.</B> To do 
        this, select the text that includes the quotes you want to change. Click 
        Format in your tool bar and select AutoFormat. Click the Options button, 
        and make sure Replace Straight Quotes With Smart Quotes is not selected 
        under both the AutoFormat and AutoFormat As You Type tabs. Then click OK 
        to exit the AutoFormat box, and your curly quotes will be changed to 
        straight quotes. 
        <P><B>Step 7: Rearrange text if necessary.</B> Do a line-by-line review 
        of your document to make sure there are no odd-looking line wraps, extra 
        spaces, or words scrunched together in the body, making adjustments 
        accordingly. This may require inserting commas between items that were 
        once in columns and are now in paragraph format because tabs and tables 
        disappeared when the document was converted to Text Only.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Now that you have the <B><I>Plain Text Resume for Posting</I></B>, it 
      takes just a few more steps to create a perfect <B><I>Plain Text Resume 
      for E-mailing</I></B>. Again, if you take the time to do this now, you 
      will save yourself a lot of time later. 
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Step 8. Limit line lengths.</B> Because each e-mail 
        software has its own the length of lines, your message may not look as 
        good when it is read by a potential employer. To avoid this problem, 
        limit each line to no more than 65 characters, including spaces. To do 
        this: 
        <OL>
          <LI>Open MS Word, click Open, select the file named "ResTextOnly.txt," 
          and click Open. <B>Warning: If you open the resume document by 
          clicking on its icon in the directory, it will be opened in Notepad -- 
          not what you want right now.</B> 
          <LI>Select the entire document and change the font to Courier, 12 pt. 
          <LI>Go to Format in your toolbar; select Page Setup (<B>Windows XP</B> 
          users will find Page Setup under File in their toolbars); set the left 
          margin at 1 inch and your right margin at 1.75 inch. <I>(Yahoo! email 
          users set your right margin at 2.5.) </I>
          <LI>Select the entire document and change the font to Times, Arial, or 
          some other standard font you like. </LI></OL>With the font, size of 
        font, and side margins set, each line of your document will be no more 
        than 65 characters and spaces. Don't worry about whether you want the 
        employer to see your resume in Courier font - his or her e-mail software 
        will convert it to the font set on his or her system. 
        <P><B>Step 9: Save as Text Only with Line Breaks.</B> To save changes 
        you made in Step 8, you must convert your Text Only document one more 
        time by doing the following: 
        <UL>
          <LI>With your Text Only resume document open, click File in your tool 
          bar and select Save As. 
          <LI>Type in a new name for this document in File Name, such as 
          "ResTextBreak." 
          <LI>Directly under this is the Save As Type pull-down menu. From this 
          list, select "Text Only with Line Breaks (*.txt)." Click Save to

      <P>Before sending your resume to an employer, run a test by sending it to 
      yourself and to a friend to see how it looks after going through the 
      Internet. This will help you identify any additional formatting problems 
      you need to correct before you start sending it out to possible employers.

      <H2><A name=rules>Rules for Responding Online</A></H2>The fastest way to 
      respond to Internet job listings is to e-mail your cover letter and resume 
      to the person or organization indicated. However, there are some simple 
      rules to follow before hitting the "send" key. 
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Look at it this way. <B>You have 15 or 20 seconds to get 
        someone's attention using email.</B> In that time, you must convince the 
        recipient to 
        <UL>
          <LI>open your email 
          <LI>read your message 
          <LI>not delete your email </LI></UL>Do it wrong, get into the wrong mail 
        box, or make someone's job harder, and the best resume in the world from 
        the most qualified person in the world will be trashed. 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Getting your email opened, read, and actually 
      <B>considered</B> really comes down to some simple rules. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <OL>
          <LI><B>Use the right Subject.</B> "Seeking employment" is not an 
          acceptable subject. If you are responding to an advertisement, use the 
          job title or job code cited in the advertisement to make it easy for 
          your e-mail to be recognized and routed to the appropriate person. If 
          you are "cold calling" an employer, put a few words stating your 
          objective in the Subject line. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Include a cover letter in your email and address it to the 
          recipient.</B> "Here's my resume, please tell me if you have any jobs 
          I might fill" is not a cover letter and does not encourage anyone to 
          look at your resume. Whether or not you are responding to an 
          advertised opening, the cover letter will introduce you, specify how 
          you meet the needs of the employer, and will encourage the recipient 
          to read your full resume. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Always send your resume in the body of the e-mail message, not 
          as an attachment.</B> Force someone to open an attachment just to get 
          to know you and your 20 seconds are over before they even start. Put 
          that resume right in the message so the recipient will see it as soon 
          as he or she opens the message. This technique also helps you get 
          through e-mail systems that reject all attachments in this day of 
          rampant computer viruses. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Make sure your resume is properly formatted for e-mail.</B> 
          Plain text resumes not formatted for email can be unreadable, and 
          unreadable resumes will most likely be deleted. Take the time to make 
          sure it will look as good on all computers and in all email systems as 
          it does on your screen. This means shorter text lines, spacing between 
          sections, and text-based highlights. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>If responding to an advertisement, read the application 
          instructions and follow them.</B> Failing to follow application 
          instructions not only delays your resume, it labels you as someone who 
          doesn't take direction well. It's the Trash bin for you. They might 
          specify an email address and job code to use. They might even actually 
          ask you to send your resume as a Word attachment. Whatever they want, 
          you do. </LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE><B>Always remember: It only takes a second 
      for someone to delete an e-mail message</B>. Don't give them a reason to 
      trash you! Think before you respond!

      <H2><A name=post>Posting your Resume: Placement vs. Privacy</A></H2><A 
      href="http://www.rileyguide.com/eresume.html#safe">Staying Cyber-Safe</A> 
      <P>With all of the possible posting sites available online, you can 
      saturate the Internet with your resumes. Is this a good thing? There are 
      two issues to consider when posting your resume online. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <OL>
          <LI>Placement: where should you post it? 
          <LI>Privacy: how public do you want it to be? 
      </LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>What's the problem? The more exposure you get, the 
      better, right? <B>Not necessarily</B>. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Recruiters get tired of finding the same resumes for the 
        same people in every database they search. If you get labeled a "resume 
        spammer," you won't be considered for job openings they are working to 
        fill. Also, the farther your resume spreads, the less control you have 
        over it and the more likely it is to be discovered by someone you had 
        hoped wouldn't see it, <I>like your current employer.</I> And yes, 
        people do get fired.</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Some problems can be avoided by merely limiting where you post your 
      resume (Placement), others by limiting the information in your posted 
      resume (Privacy), but the two issues must be addressed hand-in-hand. It is 
      possible to be visible but private online, but how visible you want to be 
      vs. how comfortable you are in public is a question only you can answer. 
      <P>
      <H3><A name=safe>Staying Cyber-Safe</A></H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Limiting your posting is a good way to protect your privacy, 
        but it is also important to select those few sites with care. <B>Susan 
        Joyce</B>, author of <A 
        href="http://www.job-hunt.org/">Job-Hunt.org</A>, encourages job seekers 
        to carefully evaluate the job sites used and to be aware of the 
        information presented in the resume. The following tips include 
        information excerpted from her articles on <A 
        href="http://www.job-hunt.org/choosing.shtml">Choosing a Job Site</A> 
        and <A href="http://www.job-hunt.org/resumecybersafe.shtml">Your 
        Cyber-Safe Resume</A>. This information was used with her <A 
        href="http://www.rileyguide.com/eresume.html#perm">permission</A>. I 
        highly recommend a visit to her site to read the full articles. 
        <P>
        <OL>
          <LI><B>Limit where you post.</B> Post your resume in the databases of 
          only one or two large popular job sites. At the same time, post it in 
          the databases of one or two smaller job sites targeted to your 
          specific industry, occupational group, or geographic location. This 
          will give you both "maximum exposure" (many employers crossing 
          industries and regions) and "targeted exposure" (employers looking for 
          a smaller yet more highly qualified candidate pool.) 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Read Privacy Policies</B>. Note what personal or "individually 
          identifiable" information they will collect, how it may be handled, 
          and whether or not they reserve the right to sell it. Some sites are 
          good and promise to never sell your info, but others reserve the right 
          to sell your personally identifiable information to third parties. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Avoid sites that force you to register a full profile (i.e., 
          your resume) before you can do any search of the job database.</B> You 
          should be allowed to evaluate a site to make sure it's a good fit to 
          you before adding your information to their database. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Avoid sites that offer to "blast" your resume.</B> Such wide 
          distribution may offer little, if any, control on where a copy of your 
          resume could end up. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Limit access to your personal contact information.</B> Options 
          range from blocking access to just the contact information to keeping 
          your resume completely out of the database searched by employers. 
          Choose the option that works best for you. <B>Remember that if you go 
          for full confidentiality, it may be up to you to remember to delete 
          contact info from your resume.</B> Many job seekers trip up here 
          because they fill out a form with their contact info, then cut and 
          paste the whole resume into the box, forgetting about the contact info 
          here. The database's protection of your contact info only refers to 
          what you put in the form, not in the box. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Modify the contact information you put on your resume.</B> 
          Remove all standard "contact information" -- name, address, phone 
          numbers -- and replace your personal e-mail address with an e-mail 
          address set up specifically for your job search. This is where those 
          services like Yahoo! email come into play. Make sure you use an 
          appropriate e-mail name like MEngineer@Yahoo.com. Names like 
          "JustLooking@Yahoo.com" or "DumbBlond@HotMail.com" are not good names 
          for serious job seekers. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Modify your employment history.</B> Remove all dates from your 
          resume. Then, remove the names of all employers and replace them with 
          accurate <I>but generic</I> descriptions. "Nuts n' Bolts Distributors, 
          Inc." becomes "a small construction supplies distribution company" and 
          "IBM" becomes "a multinational information technology company." If 
          your job title is unique, replace it with an accurate but generic 
          title, so "New England Regional Gadget Marketing Director" becomes 
          "multi-state marketing manager of gadget-class products." 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>Don't let your resume sit there.</B> Since many databases sort 
          resumes by date of submission with the newest first, renew your resume 
          every 14 days. If you don't get any response to your resume within 45 
          days of posting, remove it from that location and post it elsewhere. 
          It could be that employers are not looking for people with your skills 
          in this particular database, but it could also be that there is too 
          much competition between candidates with the same skills and your 
          resume is not rising to the top. 
          <P></P>
          <LI><B>When your job search is over, delete all resumes out there.</B> 
          Do not continue to "dangle the hook" and see what offers may come up. 
          Your new employer may find you still fishing and demand an 
          explanation. Some people are adding a "posted DATE" on the bottom of 
          resumes they register online, but you will still have a tremendous 
          amount of explaining to do if your resume is found to still be 
          circulating. Whether or not you were planning a fast exit, you may 
          find yourself on the way out the door. </LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Always remember that most job sites make their money by selling access 
      to the resume database! Many want you to post your resume in their 
      database, but few really work for you. When it comes to posting your 
      resume, <B><I>You Rule</I></B>. Be choosy.
