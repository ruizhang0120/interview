<P>
<P>Applying for a government job is something of an art. Deciphering the jargon 
and meeting all the requirements can be frustrating. Here, Amanda McCarthy of 
AJM Solutions provides an easy to follow guide to getting that government 
job.<BR><BR>In the private sector the resume is commonly used to cull and 
shortlist candidates for jobs. In the public sector, the most important thing is 
how well a candidate addresses the selection criteria.<BR><BR>If your written 
responses don't address the requirements you may not get an interview even if 
you have the most dazzling resume. It's generally a requirement for public 
sector panels to use at least one "screening" and one "selection" tool to assess 
candidates against the selection criteria. The most common selection tools used 
in the public sector include the written application and the interview.</P>
<P>Selection criteria are standards that measure a candidate's "abilities", 
"skills" and "knowledge". They are generally contained within the job 
description or may appear in the online advertisement. Both the selection 
criteria and job duties outline the minimum requirements necessary to do the 
job.</P>
<P>There are two types of selection criteria "essential" and "desirable".</P>
<P><STRONG>Essential</STRONG> <BR><BR>You must be able to address these 
selection criteria in order to apply for the job. It is mandatory.</P>
<P><STRONG>Desirable<BR></STRONG><BR>It's important and advantageous to address 
these selection criteria - particularly if you have the skills, qualifications 
or knowledge. In a competitive job market, applicants that can meet both 
essential and desirable selection criteria will invariably have a greater chance 
of being short listed.</P>
<P>Examples of selection criteria</P>
<P>Demonstrated ability to deliver a timely service to customers.</P>
<P>High level organisational and coordination skills.</P>
<P>Ability to work successfully both independently and as a member of a 
team.</P>
<P>Well-developed written and oral communication skills.</P>
<P>High-level conceptual, analytical and problem solving skills.</P>
<P><STRONG>Deciphering selection criteria</STRONG> </P>
<P>The term selection criteria often conjures up feelings of frustration and 
anxiety for most job seekers. Long, wordy and cryptic selection criteria can 
dissuade candidates from applying for public sector jobs at all. It does not 
need to be a difficult process if you break down the selection criteria into 
manageable parts. The best approach to tackle selection criteria is to underline 
the key phrases first to find out what the selection criteria is asking you to 
do and then identify any key words/skills/abilities.</P>
<P><STRONG>Underlining key phrases</STRONG> </P>
<P>Step 1 is to underline the key phrases contained within the selection 
criteria. Use the key phrases list below to decipher the selection criteria 
terminology. Key phrases will generally be the first one or two words of the 
selection criteria, however they may be scattered throughout the selection 
criteria.</P>
<P>Examples:<BR><BR>Example 1<BR><BR>High level communication skills with the 
capacity to prepare and produce reports.</P>
<P>In this example, "high level" means you must be able to give examples that 
demonstrate you have the advanced knowledge, skills and abilities required and a 
track record of being effective in a specific area. "Capacity to" means you have 
the necessary skills but you may not have applied them in the working world.</P>
<P>Example 2<BR><BR>Knowledge of or the ability to rapidly acquire knowledge of 
word processing and spreadsheet packages.</P>
<P>In this example "knowledge of" means you have been trained in a particular 
area or you have worked in a particular area and you have gained the knowledge 
required in the process. "Ability to rapidly acquire" means you must be able to 
prove that you are able to acquire knowledge or have the capacity to learn 
quickly within short timeframes.</P>
<P>Example 3<BR><BR>Demonstrated ability to manage a project team. This means 
you must provide specific examples from your work experience that demonstrate 
your practical skills and abilities in managing a project team.</P>
<P><STRONG>Identifying key words/skills/abilities</STRONG> </P>
<P>Once you have underlined the key phrases, it is critical to identify the key 
words/skills and abilities contained within the selection criteria. Ask yourself 
the following:</P>
<P><BR>What high level skills are critical to do this job?</P>
<P><BR>What do they want me to have the capacity to do?</P>
<P><BR>What do they want me to have a knowledge of?</P>
<P><BR>What do they want me to demonstrate?</P>
<P><BR>By asking these questions you will find it easy to locate the key words, 
skills and abilities that you will need to address in your written response. 
This step is an integral part of the process. If you fail to identify all the 
key words you will have only partially met the selection criteria.</P>
<P>EXAMPLES:</P>
<P>High level communication skills with the capacity to prepare and produce 
reports.</P>
<P><BR>Question: What high level skills are critical to do this job? Answer: 
communication skills</P>
<P><BR>Question: What do they want me to have the capacity to do? Answer: 
prepare/produce reports</P>
<P>Example</P>
<P>Knowledge of or the ability to rapidly acquire knowledge of word processing 
and spreadsheet packages.</P>
<P>Question: What do they want me to have knowledge or potential knowledge of? 
Answer:</P>
<P>word processing/spreadsheet packages</P>
<P>Example</P>
<P>Demonstrated ability to manage projects and work as part of a team</P>
<P>Question: What do they want me to have a demonstrated ability of? Answer: 
project management/teamwork</P>
<P>Key words and phrases in selection criteria</P>
<P>"Appreciation of" means that you are required to make a value judgement about 
the content of the matter.</P>
<P>"Awareness of" means that you need to demonstrate familiarity with the topic 
to a small extent</P>
<P>"Ability or ability to" means you must display your potential to perform a 
task you may not have performed before.</P>
<P>"Ability to rapidly acquire/capacity to" means you must be able to prove that 
you are able to acquire what is required.</P>
<P>"Capacity to" means you need to have knowledge or have the capacity to learn 
quickly or within short timeframes. "Capacity to" suggests that you have the 
necessary skills but may not have applied them practically.</P>
<P>"Basic understanding" means that you are required to have a general 
understanding or know the basic concepts.</P>
<P>"Capacity" means that you have the ability or are qualified to perform a 
task.</P>
<P>"Demonstrated" means you must be able to give specific examples from your 
work</P>
<P>"Proven experience" means you have work experience that demonstrates your 
practical skills and abilities.</P>
<P>"General knowledge" means you must possess a basic knowledge of the topic and 
can apply the information broadly.</P>
<P>"Knowledge" means you must be able to show familiarity with the content of 
the material gained from learning and experiences.</P>
<P>"High level /superior/" means you must be able to give specific examples that 
exhibit well developed/advanced knowledge, skills, abilities and effectiveness 
in the given area.</P>
<P>"Mandatory/possession" means it's obligatory to have this in order to apply 
for the position eg accounting degree, bachelor of education and so on.</P>
<P>"Sound knowledge" means you need a good working knowledge or are able to 
provide detail to prove you have the knowledge required.</P>
<P>"Thorough knowledge/Extensive Knowledge" means you must have a comprehensive 
grasp of the information.</P>
<P>"Understanding" means more than knowledge. It requires you to comprehend the 
matter and show an understanding of its significance.</P>
<P>Writing specific examples</P>
<P>The BEST method outlined below is an effective tool to construct your 
response to any selection criteria where you are required to demonstrate or 
prove your experience.</P>
<P>Best Method stands for:<BR>B-Brainstorm your ideas. Think about your work 
experience.<BR>E-Example. Use an example and outline what happened.<BR>S-Step by 
step process. List what you did step-by-step.<BR>T-The outcome. Highlight what 
the end result or outcome was.</P>
<P>Example</P>
<P>This outlines the specific example and provides some background information 
on the situation. Tell the reader what happened and provide some background or 
context.</P>
<P>Step by step process</P>
<P>This is the most challenging component of the method. It requires you to 
outline step by step how you handled the specific situation. List any actions 
you undertook to resolve the situation.</P>
<P>Step by step processes may include:<BR>Steps taken to resolve a customer's 
complaint<BR>How a project was managed/planned successfully<BR>Process used to 
negotiate with a client</P>
<P><STRONG>The Outcome</STRONG> </P>
<P>It is always important to mention what the outcome was. Think about the end 
result and highlight whether or not it was successful or effective. If the 
outcome was not successful, then list what you learnt from the process.</P>
<P>When applying the step-by-step in an interview situation use a specific 
example</P>
<P>Outline the process used or demonstrate how you performed the task. Pretend 
the panel members have never performed that task before. Your example should be 
clear, succinct and highlight step by step what you did. Mention an outcome or 
end result.</P>
<P>An example of the BEST method has been included below:</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>Brainstorm your ideas</STRONG> </P>
<P>Example</P>
<P>"In my role as Recruitment Consultant at Company X, I had the responsibility 
to manage a bulk recruitment exercise for a Banking and Finance client. It was 
my role on this project to manage the process, co-ordinate the operations and 
liaise with the client."</P>
<P>Step by Step Process</P>
<P>The following is the step-by-step process I undertook to ensure that the 
project ran to schedule:</P>
<P><BR>Defining the project<BR><BR>During the initial phase of the project, it 
was important to meet with the client face to face to define the scope of the 
project and clarify objectives. This process involved goal setting, setting 
timeframes for the project, and identifying resourcing and budgetary 
requirements. After the initial meeting, I established that 30 call centre staff 
were to be recruited and the recruitment methodology was to comprise of a phone 
interview, a role play, a group assessment, psychometric testing and reference 
checking.</P>
<P>Planning</P>
<P>During the second phase of the process I developed a recruitment methodology 
and ensured all project members were briefed on the nature of the project and 
were aligned with the client_s goals. I asked the team for ideas and information 
and encouraged them to take ownership of the project. The next step was to break 
the project into manageable parts, develop timeframes and daily targets. It was 
essential to develop a weekly timetable so that project members were aware of 
what was happening each day and in what order (eg step 1 was to resume screen 
all applicants, step 2 was to phone screen shortlisted applicants etc). I looked 
at individual team member_s strengths, allocated tasks and empowered staff to 
take responsibility for parts of the project. I also ensured that project 
members were given opportunities to learn and develop. For example if a project 
member had limited exposure to role playing, I ensured that there were 
opportunities to observe. I then devised in conjunction with the team a 
streamlined process to monitor and track all applications. Daily targets were 
set and timeframes developed. It was also instrumental to develop a contingency 
plan and identify risk management strategies.</P>
<P>Feedback and monitoring</P>
<P>During this phase, I facilitated daily communication and feedback sessions 
with the team. This was critical in order to monitor the project_s progress and 
identify any problems. There was constant liaison with the client to keep them 
abreast of any changes in the overall development of the project. It was 
important to be flexible during this stage as timeframes were often extended, 
project plans were amended and processes were modified and improved.</P>
<P>Completion of the project</P>
<P>During the final phase I evaluated the success of the project from a team 
perspective. Team members participated in a brainstorming exercise where both 
positive and negative parts of the project were highlighted. I compiled an 
written report for the client and collated raw data and scores into an excel 
spreadsheet outlining the ratings and rankings for each applicant. The client 
was also sent an evaluation sheet for feedback on the success of the bulk 
recruitment exercise.</P>
<P>The outcome</P>
<P>My ability to manage and contribute effectively to the project was validated 
by:<BR>Completion of the project on time and on budget.<BR>Positive verbal and 
written feedback from the client.</P>
<P><BR><STRONG>How do I format my Public Sector written application?</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>How you format your written application is essential.</P>
<P>Keep your application simple and well presented - this will inspire the 
selection panel to want to read more.</P>
<P>Fancy presentation folders and expensive paper are immaterial and generally 
an unnecessary expense.</P>
<P>Panel members generally prefer stapled applications printed on white crisp 
paper. The following are useful tips to capture the attention of a public sector 
recruiter.</P>
<P>Always type and number your selection criteria at the top of the page.</P>
<P>New selection criteria should be listed on a new page.</P>
<P>Bold the selection criteria to make it stand out from the rest of the 
text.</P>
<P>Type your name, job reference number and position title in the header and 
include page numbers in the footer.</P>
<P>Use lots of white spacing - makes it easier on the eye.</P>
<P>Dot points can be used as a substitute for large amounts of text/use short 
paragraphs to emphasise specific points.</P>
<P>Some Departments will specify word limits for the selection criteria - do not 
exceed the required length specified.</P>
<P>As a general rule the average length per selection criteria should be around 
1 - 1.5 pages. Where practicable, try not to write more than 2 pages.</P>
<P>Always type your application - it looks more professional.</P>
<P>Use standard typefaces such as Arial and Times New Roman (11 or 12 font 
size)</P>
<P>Use sub headings.</P>
<P>Here is an example:</P>
<P>TY97/200 Administration 
Officer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bea Successful</P>
<P>SC1&nbsp;&nbsp; Proven ability to work effectively as part of a team.</P>
<P>Working as part of a team<BR>I believe to be an effective team member you 
need to:</P>
<P>Align yourself with the goals of the team<BR>Contribute to 
decision-making<BR>Share the workload<BR>Be flexible<BR>Be open and receptive to 
others ideas</P>
<P>I have demonstrated my ability to work effectively in a team by participating 
in the SAP upgrade project. It was my role in this project to (write )</P>
<P>The step-by-step process I undertook to ensure I was an effective member of a 
team was (then write a few lines description).</P>
<P>The results were (write a few lines description)</P>
<P><STRONG>Public Sector Interviews - what to expect</STRONG> </P>
<P>The interview is a tool that is used to select the most meritorious person 
for a job. Interviews are designed to find out information about you. It is 
through well-constructed questioning techniques that the selection panel can 
elicit the following information: WHO you are what skills, abilities, knowledge, 
qualifications and relevant work experience you have had and<BR>WHY you are the 
best person for the job.</P>
<P>The interview also allows you to:</P>
<P>Sell yourself in person Clarify and expand on information contained within 
the written application It also serves as a validation tool for the panel to 
confirm that the contents of the written application are true and accurate.</P>
<P><STRONG>Information you should know prior to the interview</STRONG> </P>
<P>When you are contacted for an interview, the panel should provide you with a 
host of information such as:</P>
<P>Selection criteria weightings (if applicable); The selection panel may use a 
numerical rating scale to rate the importance of each selection criteria (eg 10 
may be most important and 1 may be least important). This information is useful, 
particularly when you are managing your preparation time. Always allocate more 
time and energy to selection criteria worth the highest weightings.</P>
<P>Day, date, time and venue for the interview;</P>
<P>Number of people on the panel and the panel members names; Take note of all 
panel members names and use this information to personally greet all 
interviewers on the day. This demonstrates initiative and creates a favourable 
impression.</P>
<P>Format and duration of the interview; Some panels allocate time for 
candidates to preview interview questions prior to the interview (perusal time). 
It is important to establish if this will be the case and confirm the duration 
of the interview.</P>
<P>Other materials to bring (evidence of qualifications, samples of work 
etc);</P>
<P>Selection tools being used to assess performance;<BR>There are a multiplicity 
of selection tools which panel members can use for screening and selection. 
Before the interview it is essential for you to know what tools you will be 
assessed against. Common public sector selection tools include the interview, 
practical tests, assessment centres, presentations, case studies and 
psychological tests)</P>
<P>Any special requirements (ie interpreter, wheel chair access);</P>
<P>Total number of shortlisted applicants.</P>
<P><STRONG>Format of the Interview</STRONG> </P>
<P>Public Sector selection panels comprise of a chair of the panel and panel 
members. The chair of the panel is generally the manager of the work area where 
the position is vacant, the second panel member is often the specialist in the 
field (e.g. IT, HR, Marketing) and the third person is independent of the work 
area and sometimes can be a representative from Human Resources. Selection 
committees generally comprise of a minimum of 2 members, including the 
chairperson.</P>
<P>The composition of a selection panel should include gender and target group 
representation where practicable.</P>
<P>Some panels may take turns in asking you separate questions. It is important 
to maintain eye contact with all panel members and shift your glance 
accordingly.</P>
<P>Always be prepared for multi-faceted, behavioural or scenario type 
questions.</P>
<P>Most panel members tend to write copious notes during the interview unless 
they have a scribe. Panel members have a large administrative burden and are 
accountable for recording and documenting your responses in the interview.</P>
<P>Panels will often read the selection criteria first before asking the 
interview question.</P>
<P>Some panels allow perusal time prior to the interview to help counteract 
anxiety and stress. This is at the panel_s discretion and is not a mandatory 
public sector requirement. During perusal time, candidates have the opportunity 
to read the interview questions in advance and take notes. Perusal time can vary 
from 10-30 minutes depending on the complexity of the questions and the 
seniority of the positions.</P>
