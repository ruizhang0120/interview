selection criteria in a total of no more than 200 words per question. Your 
response must be written in essay form and should not include dot points or 
lists. You do not need to repeat the selection criteria in your answer. Your 
response will leave a better impression if it is well presented, with correct 
grammar and spelling.<BR><BR>There is no right or wrong way to set out your 
responses but you should answer the questions by giving us examples that 
demonstrate your claims. Examples could be taken from your university career, 
paid/voluntary work experience, and extra-curricular activities. You should 
expand on your examples by describing what was involved in the process and the 
role you played. <BR><BR>Applicants are strongly encouraged to draft their 
responses to the selection criteria in a word processor and then copy and paste 
them into your application. If you are using Microsoft Word, ensure that smart 
quotes are disabled otherwise quotation marks may be saved as question marks 
when you save your application. If this has occurred you can simply over-type 
the question mark with the correct quotation mark and save again.<BR><BR>Apart 
from leaving a paragraph return at the end of each paragraph, there is no need 
to format your responses.<BR><A

message asking you to reduce the number of words. A word count is displayed at 
the bottom of each response. This word count is refreshed whenever you save the
