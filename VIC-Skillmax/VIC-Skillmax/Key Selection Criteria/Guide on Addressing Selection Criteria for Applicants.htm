      <P>&nbsp;</P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Acknowledgement</STRONG><BR>This Commonwealth 
      document was created by the Australian Public Service Commission in 
      consultation with Saville and Holdsworth Australia Pty Ltd.</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>INTRODUCTION</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>If you apply for a role in the Australian Public Service, 
      you are likely to be required to lodge an application that addresses 
      specific selection criteria. Applicants are short-listed based on their 
      ability to convince the Selection Team that they have the capabilities 
      required to perform the role-capabilities which are articulated in the 
      selection criteria.</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>WHAT ARE SELECTION CRITERIA AND HOW ARE THEY 
      USED?</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>Selection criteria describe the personal qualities, 
      skills, abilities, knowledge and qualifications (if any) a person needs to 
      perform the role effectively. They are used to identify the right person 
      for the role.</P>
      <P align=justify>Selection criteria are sometimes divided into:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI>IMPORTANT criteria 
        <LI>LESS IMPORTANT criteria </LI></UL></DIV>
      <P align=justify>Important criteria are weighted equally (unless 
      explicitly stated otherwise).<BR>Less Important criteria are rated equally 
      and have a lower weighting than Important criteria. However, your chances 
      of progressing through the selection process (e.g. being short-listed) 
      will be greater if you meet all the selection criteria, as you may be 
      competing against many applicants.</P>
      <P align=justify>Selection criteria can also be divided into:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI>Essential criteria (‘must have’ criteria) 
        <LI>Desirable criteria (‘nice to have’ criteria). </LI></UL></DIV>
      <P align=justify>The selection advisory committee will rate applicants 
      against the criteria in order to select the right applicant.</P>
      <P align=justify>You must meet all of the ‘essential’ criteria in order to 
      be seriously considered for a role. It is not necessary for you to have 
      the qualifications, skills and knowledge outlined in ‘desirable’ criteria. 
      However, your chances of progressing through the selection process (e.g. 
      being short-listed) will be greater if you meet all the selection 
      criteria, as you may be competing against many applicants. </P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>HOW DO APPLICANTS ADDRESS SELECTION 
      CRITERIA?</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>The key is to:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI>demonstrate capability by providing evidence of how you meet the 
        selection criteria; 
        <LI>provide specific details; and 
        <LI>where possible, include an indicator of success or a result. 
      </LI></UL></DIV>
      <P align=justify>An easy way to do this is to use the 
      <STRONG>STAR</STRONG> model – that is:</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>S</STRONG>ituation – provide a brief outline of 
      the situation or setting<BR><STRONG>T</STRONG>ask – outline what you 
      did<BR><STRONG>A</STRONG>pproach or action – outline how you did 
      it<BR><STRONG>R</STRONG>esult – describe the outcomes.</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Step one – Understanding the selection 
      criteria</STRONG> </P>
      <P align=justify>As an example, take the capability written communication 
      skills. The associated selection criterion could be;</P>
      <P align=justify>Well developed written communication skills. This 
      includes the ability to:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI>structure written communications such as reports to meet the needs 
        and understanding of the intended audience; 
        <LI>express opinions, information and key points of an argument clearly 
        and concisely; and to 
        <LI>write convincingly in an engaging and expressive manner’. 
      </LI></UL></DIV>
      <P align=justify>It is important that you clearly understand what is meant 
      by each selection criterion before putting pen to paper.</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Step two – Opening sentence</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>When addressing each selection criterion, you should 
      begin with an opening sentence that clearly states your claim to this 
      criterion. For example:</P>
      <P align=justify>I possess strong written communication skills, which I 
      have developed over the course of my career’.</P>
      <P align=justify>This opening statement needs to be supported by detailed 
      examples of where you demonstrated these skills in the workplace (or other 
      context if workplace examples are not possible). The following steps will 
      help you to provide a structured, easy-to-understand response.</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Step three – Brainstorm ideas for each 
      criterion</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>For each selection criterion, brainstorm ideas from your 
      recent work life. Ideally, you should confine your examples to the last 
      two or three years of employment. Where you do not have relevant work 
      examples, situations from different aspects of your life (e.g. university, 
      clubs or the community) may also demonstrate relevant strengths. For 
      instance, acting as the secretary for a large club may be an appropriate 
      example for the selection criterion described above. </P>
      <P align=justify>Let’s take an example of a Senior Project Officer (APS6) 
      role, which includes ‘well developed written communication skills’ as one 
      of the selection criteria. An applicant may come up with the following 
      situations which could illustrate their written communication skills:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI>Project Officer at Department of XYZ – needed to write report on 
        project planning methodologies 
        <LI>when Research Support Officer at Department of XYZ – designed and 
        compiled a monthly newsletter 
        <LI>research project when at GBL Company – needed to collate diverse 
        sets of data, organise the information into topic areas, and synthesise 
        into a paper for senior management. </LI></UL></DIV>
      <P align=justify>At this stage, it is useful to generate as many examples 
      as possible. </P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Step four – Expand on your brainstorming ideas – 
      provide the evidence</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>You should then expand upon the points that you have 
      noted as part of the brainstorming activity in step three. Go back to each 
      specific criterion and make your final choice on which examples to use, by 
      matching them against the wording of the criterion.</P>
      <P align=justify>Once you have finalised your examples, you need to 
      demonstrate how they meet the different aspects of the criterion. In doing 
      so, it is important that you are very specific and describe exactly what 
      you did, including the outcome. This is to demonstrate convincingly that 
      you have met the requirements of each criterion.</P>
      <P align=justify>Here, the <STRONG>STAR</STRONG> method described earlier 
      can be used.</P>
      <P align=justify>For example:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI>Situation – Role as Research Support Officer at Department of XYZ 
        <LI>Task – Needed to ensure that managers were kept informed of policies 
        and procedures 
        <LI>Action or approach – Initiated monthly newsletter, which was emailed 
        to each manager. Took responsibility for writing the main articles. This 
        involved obtaining ideas and input from other stakeholders to ensure 
        that the articles reflected managers’ needs (in terms of content and 
        language) 
        <LI>Result – Feedback was consistently excellent. Received divisional 
        achievement award for newsletter quality. Led to improved lines of 
        communication between managers and the Research Support Unit. 
      </LI></UL></DIV>
      <P align=justify>Once this has been achieved, the applicant can then write 
      the draft paragraph in full. For example: </P>
      <P align=justify>'As Research Support Officer at the Department of XYZ, I 
      needed to ensure that managers were kept informed of policies and 
      procedures. To do this, I initiated a monthly newsletter, which was 
      emailed to each manager. I took responsibility for writing the main 
      articles in each publication. This involved obtaining ideas and input from 
      other stakeholders to ensure that the articles reflected the needs of 
      managers, both in terms of content and language. I received consistently 
      excellent feedback in relation to this newsletter from these internal 
      clients and my own manager. I received a divisional achievement award for 
      the quality of this newsletter from management. Importantly, this 
      initiative resulted in improved lines of communication between managers 
      and the Research Support Unit’.</P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Step five – Checking work</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>At this stage, you should read through your application, 
      and check the following points:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI><STRONG>Have I used positive and specific language? 
      </STRONG></LI></UL></DIV>
      <UL>
        <LI>
        <P align=justify>It is important that you avoid ambiguous or unclear 
        expressions such as ‘involved in’ or ‘assisted’. These expressions make 
        it difficult for the reader to understand exactly what you did. For 
        example, instead of ‘I assisted the process through a monthly 
        newsletter’, this idea has been phrased as ‘I initiated a monthly 
        newsletter’.</P>
        <P align=justify>Words and phrases which could reduce credibility should 
        also be avoided (e.g. some, a little, limited, somewhat).</P>
        <LI>
        <DIV align=justify><STRONG>Have I used strong action (doing) 
        words?</STRONG> </DIV>
        <P align=justify>Avoid using passive language when describing your 
        experience. For example, ‘I received consistently excellent feedback in 
        relation to this newsletter from these internal clients and my own 
        manager’, is better than simply stating, ‘Feedback in relation to this 
        newsletter was consistently excellent’. </P>
        <LI>
        <DIV align=justify><STRONG>Have I avoided unsupported claims about my 
        capabilities?</STRONG> </DIV>
        <P align=justify>For example, rather than simply saying, ‘The newsletter 
        was received well by others’, this assertion is substantiated in the 
        following way: </P>
        <P align=justify>‘I received a divisional achievement award from 
        management for the quality of this newsletter’.</P>
        <LI>
        <DIV align=justify><STRONG>Have I addressed all aspects of the 
        criterion?</STRONG> </DIV>
        <P align=justify>At this stage, it is important that you go back to the 
        wording of the particular selection criterion. As mentioned earlier, 
        ‘Well developed written communication skills’ includes the following 
        components:</P>
        <DIV align=justify>
        <UL>
          <LI>structure written communications such as reports to meet the needs 
          and understanding of the intended audience; 
          <LI>express opinions, information and key points of an argument 
          clearly and concisely; and to 
          <LI>write convincingly in an engaging and expressive manner. 
        </LI></UL></DIV>
        <P align=justify>In reading the paragraph written earlier, it is clear 
        that its content refers mainly to the first descriptor, that is, 
        ‘Structure written communications to meet the needs and understanding of 
        the intended audience’.</P>
        <P align=justify>Therefore, it will be important that the applicant 
        addresses the remaining two descriptors in additional paragraphs which 
        will comprise the full statement for the criterion ‘well developed 
        written communication skills’. </P>
        <LI>
        <DIV align=justify><STRONG>Have I paid attention to the language of the 
        criterion?</STRONG> </DIV>
        <P align=justify>For example, writing a paragraph around an example 
        which demonstrates ‘Well developed written communication skills’ 
        requires the applicant to focus on actual experiences which show the 
        extent of their skills in this area. However, if the criterion was 
        phrased as ‘Knowledge of effective written communication skills and 
        techniques’, this would require different examples which do not 
        necessarily rely on the applicant describing their actual performance in 
        the workplace.</P></LI></UL>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Layout</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>Where appropriate, dot points should be used, rather than 
      using long paragraphs of text. This ensures that the statement is as easy 
      as possible for the selection team to read (and also demonstrates written 
      communication skills in the document itself). </P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Length</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>Conciseness is important in a document of this type. 
      About 250 words is generally an appropriate length for each criterion. 
      However, this may depend upon factors such as the role being applied for. 
      </P>
      <P align=justify><STRONG>Presentation</STRONG></P>
      <P align=justify>You should ensure that:</P>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <UL>
        <LI>there are no errors anywhere in the document; 
        <LI>the document is formatted neatly; and 
        <LI>the sentences are grammatically correct and concise.
